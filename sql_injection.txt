1. What string did you use to clear the database. How did you figure out that this was the correct string to input?
The string we put in to clear the database was "get name=6;DROP TABLE soldier;--".
We figured out pretty easily from the xcd meme, we'd want to include the command
DROP TABLE <tableName>;--. However, we also suspected that just including this
would not work, and that we'd want to include a command that the database
would recognize/allow at the beginning and then include the DROP TABLE soldier after.
To figure out what to do with that, we knew pretty quickly that we could either
get or add to the table, and since we could view the table, we used get <condition> = value and
then followed that up with a semicolon, and our DROP TABLE command to get a working injection.
When we used this command we got the error: ERROR: no such table: soldier (code 1)

2. Keep playing with the database. What else were you able to get the app to do?
We realized that with this method we could delete select data or modify data
with the second command after the get name=6; We could use get <condition>; DELETE FROM
and although it did not work, we believe if we formatted it correctly, we could use the
get <condition; ADD <some value> in order to add values to the table.

3.How might you ensure that SQL injections canâ€™t occur on your own software?
The best way would be to perform heavy input validation as well as using escape
characters to prevent the harmful injection of SQL queries into your querying code;

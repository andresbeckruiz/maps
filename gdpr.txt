Practical Implications of GDPR

Question 1:
GDPR requires that you specify exactly what you intend to do with each data point. Consider each data point that
you’re gathering from your users (Name, location, timestamp). Writing to a user, justify why each data point is
needed in an imaginary final version of your application: what eventual functionality might use the data?
Consider a more complex application that you’ve interacted with before (Facebook, Steam, MyAnimeList) -
why might it be difficult to delete all of the data on a user? Consider factors unique to the application you've
chosen; specifically those other than volume or size of data.

Answer 1:
It is necessary to get each data point from the user, who may have multiple check-ins, in knowing which exact
data should be deleted. On a more complex application, such as Facebook, a user interacts with the site in a
multitude of fashions, and accessing all of their past data (comments, likes, watched videos, etc.) could be
excessively large and extremely difficult.
